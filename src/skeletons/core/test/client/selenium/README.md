1. How to setup Chrome Driver

Since Firefox is supported by Selenium out of the box. We need to add the WebKit Based browser Chrome for testing. First, go to Chromedriver (http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list) page to download, then drop it into the System Path folder.
In this case, I am dropping into `/usr/local/bin`, it will be searched by default when terminal is running the chrome browser testing.
